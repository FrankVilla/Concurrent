/// Multicast unbounded FIFO streams.  IChans differ from regular chans because
/// you are only given access to a write-once head.  Any attempts to write
/// multiple times to an `IChan` head will fail catastrophically.  However,
/// every write operation to an IChan spawns a new write head that you can use
/// to continue writing values into the stream.
///
/// `IChan`s are multicast channels, meaning there is no such thing as "taking a
/// value out of the stream" like there is with regular channels.  Multiple
/// readers of the channel will all see the same values.
